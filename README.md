# Echoes of a Life


**Echoes of a Life** is a poignant, narrative-driven puzzle game created as a single HTML file. It combines the strategic depth of a "match-three" puzzle with a powerful, real-life theme: the fight to hold onto memories against the encroaching fog of dementia.

## The Concept: The Polaroid Projector

> The mind is a projector, full of memories like slides in a tray. But **Dementia**, like a broken slide, threatens to darken the screen.

In **Echoes of a Life**, you don't just match tiles; you piece together the fading fragments of a lifetime. Each move is an attempt to restore a memory to clarity, letting its light push back the encroaching dark. The game is designed to feel tactile, nostalgic, and deeply personal, using the metaphor of a vintage slide projector to tell its story.

- **The Grid** is a slide carousel, with empty slots waiting for a memory.
- **Dementia Tiles** are broken, shattered slides that block your progress.
- **Memory Fragments** are faded Polaroids of cherished moments.
- **A Match** restores a memory to its full, brilliant clarity, unleashing a powerful effect.

## How to Play

The goal is to survive as long as you can by preventing the grid from being completely filled with Dementia or memory fragments.

1.  **Choose a Memory:** Below the grid, you will be offered a choice of two memory fragments.
2.  **Place it on the Grid:** Drag your chosen Polaroid onto any **empty, recessed slot** on the board.
3.  **Form a Memory Echo:** Line up **three fragments of the same color/category** in a row or column to form a match.
4.  **Push Back the Dementia:** A successful match will create a powerful "Memory Echo" that clears Dementia tiles in a specific pattern.

### The Memories

As you score points and reach new levels, you will delve deeper and unlock new, more complex types of memories:

| Level | Memory Type                                            | Effect                                                       |
| :---- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | <strong style="color:#c78a44">Pets (üê∂üê±üê∞)</strong>      | Clears a single row or column.                               |
| **2** | <strong style="color:#5a9a93">Occasions (üéÇüéÑüèñÔ∏è)</strong> | Clears a 3x3 area.                                           |
| **3** | <strong style="color:#8c6b99">Relatives (üë®üë©üëß)</strong> | Clears a massive cross-pattern of three rows OR three columns. |
| **4+** | <strong style="color:#d17b7b">The Heartstone (‚ù§Ô∏è)</strong> | A rare, lucid memory that clears a 5x5 area and can be placed on **any** tile. |

### The Threat

- **Dementia:** Black, shattered tiles that block placement.
- **Stubborn Dementia:** A darker, more fractured tile that requires **two** Memory Echo hits to be fully cleared. On the first hit, it will downgrade to a regular Dementia tile.

## A Note on the Theme

This game touches on the sensitive and deeply human experience of dementia. It was designed with care and respect, not as a direct simulation, but as a metaphorical exploration of the struggle to hold onto one's identity, the power of cherished memories, and the quiet beauty of a life lived. We hope it resonates with players in a meaningful way.
